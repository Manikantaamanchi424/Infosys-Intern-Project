🌍 ImpactSense - Earthquake Impact Prediction
📌 Project Overview

ImpactSense is a machine learning project designed to predict the impact of earthquakes in terms of magnitude, damage level, or risk zone classification. By leveraging geophysical and environmental data (latitude, longitude, depth, seismic features, geological parameters), the system helps in:

Early disaster planning

Emergency response prioritization

Risk assessment for urban development

🚀 Use Cases

Urban Risk Assessment → Identify high-risk regions in populated areas.

Infrastructure Planning → Guide construction policies in earthquake-prone zones.

Government Disaster Response → Prioritize regions for rescue and aid deployment.

🎯 Project Outcomes

By the end of the project, this system will:
✔️ Analyze and preprocess seismic/geospatial data
✔️ Train & evaluate machine learning models (classification/regression)
✔️ Visualize results & model performance
✔️ Optionally deploy a user interface for real-time predictions

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Includes geophysical parameters like magnitude, depth, soil type, latitude, longitude.
