ImpactSense - Earthquake Impact Prediction
📌 Project Overview

ImpactSense is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the impact of earthquakes in terms of magnitude, damage level, or risk zone classification. The model leverages geophysical and environmental data such as latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave features, and geological parameters to assess possible damage or categorize severity.

This project aims to support disaster preparedness, urban planning, and emergency response by providing reliable earthquake impact predictions.

🚀 Key Features

Urban Risk Assessment: Predict the effect of earthquakes in populated areas.

Infrastructure Planning: Guide construction policies in high-risk zones.

Disaster Response: Help governments and NGOs prioritize rescue and aid.

Model Explainability: SHAP values and feature importance visualizations.

User Interface (Optional): Simple UI using Streamlit / FastAPI for real-time predictions.
